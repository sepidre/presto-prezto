# presto-prezto

> Inspired by and based on [gh-zsh](https://github.com/gustavohellwig/gh-zsh) repository

A simple one-shot script to setup an awesome shell environment for Ubuntu and MacOS, with:
* [Prezto](https://github.com/sorin-ionescu/prezto) - Zsh framework with several nice built-in plugins
* [junegunn/fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) - fuzzy search for command line
* [clvv/fasd](https://github.com/clvv/fasd) - allows to run commands from history without fully typing them
* [Peltoche/lsd](https://github.com/Peltoche/lsd) (LSDeluxe) - enables more informative, colored `ls` output
* [yuhonas/zsh-aliases-lsd](https://github.com/yuhonas/zsh-aliases-lsd) - adds `ls` aliases to work with LSDeluxe
* [powerlevel10k](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k) - an awesome shell theme
* (optional) [Meslo Nerd Font](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k#meslo-nerd-font-patched-for-powerlevel10k) - font recommended by the creator of _Powerlevel10k_ theme, adds multiple icons and glyphs to further improve the looks and readability

## Installation

### Simple (without the custom font)

Run the installation script:
``` bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JGroxz/presto-prezto/main/presto-prezto.sh | bash
```

### Advanced (with Meslo Nerd Font)

1. Run the installation script with the `--font` flag:
   ``` bash
   curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JGroxz/presto-prezto/main/presto-prezto.sh | bash -s -- --font
   ```
2. Set up your terminal to use the new Meslo Nerd Font by following the [instructions here](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k#meslo-nerd-font-patched-for-powerlevel10k).

## Demo

After the installation is complete, the command prompt will look like this:
![ZSH-Prompt](./look.png)
...or like this, if you installed the version with the Meslo Nerd Font:
![ZSH-Prompt](./look-with-nerd-font.png)

## Notes
* If you are already using zsh, your zsh config will be backed up to .zshrc-backup-date.
* If the text/icons look broken, make sure your terminal is using one of the Nerd fonts.
* Tested on:
  * Ubuntu 20.04
  * MacOS 10.14, and 11.3
